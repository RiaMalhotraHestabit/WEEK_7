As a result, Liberty Media employees, including our named executive officers other than Mr .

PROXY STATEMENT FOR ANNUAL MEETING OF STOCKHOLDERS We are furnishing this proxy statement in connection with the Board of Directors\u2019 solicitation of proxies for use at our 2023 Annual Meeting of Stockholders to be held at 8:30 a.m., Mountain time, on June 6, 2023 or at any adjournment or postponement of the annual meeting. The annual meeting will be held via the Internet and will be a completely virtual meeting of stockholders. Y ou may attend the meeting, submit questions and vote your shares electronically during the meeting via the Internet by visiting www .virtualshareholdermeeting.com/LBRD2023. At the annual meeting, we will ask you to consider and vote on the proposals described in the accompanying Notice of Annual Meeting of Stockholders. The proposals are described in more detail in this proxy statement. We are soliciting proxies from holders of our Series A common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( LBRDA), Series B common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( LBRDB), and our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.01 per share ( LBRDP). The holders of our Series C common stock, par value $0.01 per share ( LBRDK), are not entitled to any voting powers, except as required by Delaware law , and may not vote on the proposals to be presented at the annual meeting. We refer to LBRDA, LBRDB, and LBRDP together as our voting stock. We refer to our voting stock together with LBRDK as our capital stock. PROXY SUMMARY 8 / 2023 PROXY STATEMENT DEDUCTIBILITY OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION In developing the 2022 compensation packages for the named executive officers, the deductibility of executive compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code is considered. That provision prohibits the deduction of compensation of more than $1 million paid to certain executives, subject to certain exceptions. Following the enactment of the T ax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, beginning with the 2018 calendar year , the executives potentially affected by the limitations of Section 162(m) of the Code have been expanded and there is no longer any exception for qualified performance-based compensation. Therefore, portions of the compensation we pay to the named executive officers may not be deductible due to the application of Section 162(m) of the Code. Our compensation committee believes that the lost deduction on compensation payable in excess of the $1 million limitation for the named executive officers is not material relative to the benefit of being able to attract and retain talented management. RECOUPMENT PROVISIONS In those instances where we grant equity-based incentive compensation, we expect to include in the related agreement with the executive a right, in favor of our company , to require the executive to repay or return to the company any cash, stock or other incentive compensation (including proceeds from the disposition of shares received upon exercise of options or stock appreciation rights). That right will arise if (1) a material restatement of any of our financial statements is required and (2) in the reasonable judgment of our compensation committee, (A) such restatement is due to material noncompliance with any financial reporting requirement under applicable securities laws and (B) such noncompliance is a result of misconduct on the part of the executive. In determining the amount of such repayment or return, our compensation committee may take into account, among other factors it deems relevant, the extent to which the market value of the applicable series of our common stock was affected by the errors giving rise to the restatement. The cash, stock or other compensation that we may require the executive to repay or return must have been received by the executive during the 12-month period beginning on the date of the first public issuance or the filing with the SEC, whichever occurs earlier , of the financial statement requiring restatement. The compensation required to be repaid or returned will include (1) cash or company stock received by the executive (A) upon the exercise during that 12-month period of any stock appreciation right held by the executive or (B) upon the payment during that 12-month period of any incentive compensation, the value of which is determined by reference to the value of company stock, and (2) any proceeds received by the executive from the disposition during that 12-month period of company stock received by the executive upon the exercise, vesting or payment during that 12-month period of any award of equity-based incentive compensation. Beginning in December 2020, we also began including in new forms of equity-based award agreements COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OVERVIEW 3 meetings in 2022 Co-Chairs Julie D. Frist J.

Hamilton Compensation Committee Report, page 50 The compensation committee assists the Board in discharging its responsibilities relating to compensation of the company\u2019s executives and produces an annual report on executive compensation for inclusion in our annual proxy statement. In November 2014, the spin-off of our company (formerly a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Media) from Liberty Media was completed (the Broadband Spin-Off). In connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, we entered into a Services Agreement, dated November 4, 2014, with Liberty Media (the services agreement), pursuant to which Liberty Media provides us with administrative, executive and management services. Key Responsibilities: \u2022 Evaluate the services fee under the services agreement on at least an annual basis, subject to certain exceptions (such as in 2019 during the then-ongoing negotiations relating to Mr . Maffei\u2019s compensation arrangement); \u2022 May approve incentive awards or other forms of compensation to employees of Liberty Media who are providing services to our company , which employees include our executive officers. The compensation committee determined to grant equity award compensation for 2022 (see \u201cExecutive Compensation\u2014 Compensation Discussion and Analysis\u201d); \u2022 If we engage a chief executive officer , chief accounting officer , principal financial officer , chief legal officer , chief administrative officer or chief corporate development officer to perform services for our company outside the services agreement, review and approve corporate goals and objectives relevant to the compensation of any such person; and \u2022 Oversee the compensation of the chief executive officers of any non-public operating subsidiaries of our company .

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANAL YSIS SERVICES AGREEMENT In connection with the Broadband Spin-Off, we entered into the services agreement (the services agreement ) with Liberty Media in November 2014, pursuant to which Liberty Media provides to our company certain administrative and management services, and we pay Liberty Media a monthly management fee, the amount of which is subject to a quarterly review by our audit committee (and at least an annual review by our compensation committee). As a result, Liberty Media employees, including our named executive officers other than Mr . Maffei, who is paid certain compensation elements directly by our company pursuant to the amended services agreement (as described below), are typically not separately compensated by our company other than with respect to equity awards with respect to our common stock and with respect to performance-based cash bonuses.

Maffei was assigned a target bonus opportunity under the performance-based bonus program equal to $17 million in the aggregate for Liberty Media, our company and each of the other Service Companies. That bonus amount was split among, and payable directly by , Liberty Media, our company and each of the other Service Companies, with payment subject to the achievement of one or more performance metrics as determined by the applicable company\u2019s compensation committee. In 2022, the portion of Mr . Maffei\u2019s aggregate target bonus amount allocated to our company was 33% or $5,610,000. The portions of Mr . Maffei\u2019s aggregate target bonus amount allocated to each of Liberty Media, Qurate Retail and Liberty T ripAdvisor pursuant to the amended services agreements were 49% (or $8,330,000), 13% (or $2,210,000) and 5% (or $850,000), respectively . Messrs. Maffei, Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm were assigned in March 2022 a maximum bonus opportunity under the performance-based bonus program, which would be allocated to each of our company , Liberty Media, Qurate Retail and Liberty T ripAdvisor in the same percentage as the allocation for Mr . Maffei\u2019s target bonus opportunity (the Maximum Performance Bonus ). The portion of the Maximum Performance Bonus allocated to the Liberty Broadband program was $11,220,000, $409,155, $748,590 and $748,868 for Messrs. Maffei, Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm, respectively (the Liberty Broadband Maximum Performance Bonus ). The Liberty Broadband Maximum Performance Bonus amounts are up to 200% of Mr .

Wilm $ 421,238 $ 97,353 $ 63,654 $ 582,244 Our compensation committee then noted that, when combined with the total 2022 performance-based bonus amounts paid by Liberty Media and the other Service Companies to the overlapping named executive officers, Messrs. Maffei, Wendling and Rosenthaler and Ms. Wilm received $23,158,250, $871,004, $1,593,590 and $1,764,377, respectively . For more information regarding these bonus awards, please see the \u201cGrants of Plan-Based Awards\u201d table below . EQUITY INCENTIVE COMPENSA TION The 2019 incentive plan provides for the grant of a variety of incentive awards, including stock options, restricted shares, RSUs, SARs and performance awards. Subject to share availability considerations, our compensation committee has a preference for grants of stock options and awards of restricted stock or RSUs (as compared with other types of available awards under the 2019 incentive plan) based on the belief that they better promote retention of key employees through the continuing, long-term nature of an equity investment. It is the policy of our compensation committee that stock options be awarded with an exercise price equal to fair market value on the date of grant, typically measured by reference to the closing price on the grant date. As discussed above, our executive officers perform management services for our company pursuant to the amended services agreement. In consultation with the compensation Committees of each of Liberty Media and the other Service Companies, our compensation committee determined that each of our company , Liberty Media and the other Service Companies would grant a proportionate share of the aggregate equity grant value to each named executive officer each year for their service to our company and each of Liberty Media and the other Service Companies. The proportionate share for each company was determined based 50% on the relative market capitalization and 50% on relative time spent by Liberty Media\u2019s employees working for such issuer . With respect to awards made to Mr . Maffei, the 2019 Maffei Employment Agreement provides that Mr . Maffei\u2019s aggregate annual equity award value will be granted across Liberty Media and the Service Companies by Liberty Media\u2019s compensation committee, our determination of the consolidated corporate performance of our company , Liberty Media and the other Service Companies. Under the corollary program of Liberty Media and the corollary programs of the other Service Companies, each participant was entitled to receive from each of Liberty Media and the other Service Companies a bonus that is 40% of each of Liberty Media\u2019s and the other Service Companies\u2019 allocable portion of the Maximum Performance Bonus, which was subject to reduction based on a determination of the consolidated corporate performance of our company , Liberty Media and the other Service Companies. In December 2022, our compensation committee and the compensation committees of Liberty Media and each other Service Company reviewed contemporaneously our respective named executive officers\u2019 individual performance and consolidated corporate performance under each company\u2019s program. Notwithstanding this joint effort, our compensation committee retained sole and exclusive discretion with respect to the approval of award terms and amounts payable under our bonus program. Individual Performance Bonus . Our compensation committee reviewed the individual performance of each participant to determine the reductions that would apply to each participant\u2019s Liberty Broadband Maximum Individual Bonus. Our compensation committee took into account a variety of factors, without assigning a numerical weight to any single performance measure. This determination was based on reports to our Board, the observations of committee members throughout the year , executive self-evaluations and, with respect to the participants other than Mr . Maffei, the observations and input of Mr . Maffei. In evaluating the performance of each of the participants for determining the reduction that would apply to each named executive officer\u2019s Liberty Broadband Maximum Individual Bonus, the following performance objectives related to our company which had been assigned to each participant for 2022 were considered: GREGORY B. MAFFEI President and Chief Executive Officer Performance Objectives: \u2022 Effectively represent our company on Charter\u2019s Board and assist with various management, strategic and operational matters \u2022 Provide leadership and development opportunities to our management team, including support of a succession plan at our company \u2022 Support GCI management team in navigating governmental framework, including compliance enhancement \u2022 Evaluate investment and strategic opportunities \u2022 Continue development of ESG program BRIAN J.
